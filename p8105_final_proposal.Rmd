### Project Title 

Analysis of Gun Violence in the United States in 2014-2023

### Motivation for Project 

Gun violence is a public health and safety issue in the United States, which consistently experiences higher levels of firearm-related incidents compared to other developed countries. This project seeks to provide an analysis of gun violence across dimensions (i.e., temporal, geographic, and demographic factors). With the constitutional right to bear arms embedded in American society, understanding patterns and trends in gun violence could help guide policymakers, law enforcement, and public health officials in informing strategies involving gun violence. 

Objectives: 

 - Analyze trends in gun violence over time 
 - Identify high-risk time periods for gun violence incidents
 - Assess differences in gun violence across states and cities (identifying regions with disproportionately high incident rates)
 - Assess factors associated with high incident rates in certain demographics and areas 

### Intended Final Products 

- Interactive webpage that has the overview of the project and findings (including interactive charts and maps) 
- A written report that describes our analysis and findings in detail (i.e., trends, patterns about gun violence in the United States) 
Screencast to introduce the project, findings, visualizations 
Individual peer assessment
