### Motivation
Gun violence remains a significant public health issue in the United States. Our project explores gun-related incidents (mass shootings) in the U.S. from 2018 to 2024. These events, unfortunately, have become increasingly common, with significant implications for public safety, policy, and mental health. This project aims to identify trends, patterns, and geographic hotspots associated with these tragic events. These insights can inform policymakers, law enforcement, and public health initiatives targeting gun violence reduction. The analysis includes temporal trends, geographic distribution, and incident severity. 

### Related Work
Existing research on mass shootings has often focused on patterns of violence, gun control, and the social factors that influence the occurrence of these tragic events. Our project seeks to build on this body of research by employing statistical methods to reveal more refined insights into the data. The project draws inspiration from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) website (which aggregates mass shooting data), and from recent academic literature focusing on geographic and temporal trends in gun violence. Classroom analyses of spatial data also guided this work.

### Initial Questions 
We started with basic questions such as:

* What are the spatial and temporal trends in mass shootings from 2018-2024?
* Are there patterns in the number of casualties (`dead`, `injured`, `total`) based on location or time of year?
* How does the distribution of mass shootings vary across cities and states?

As the analysis progressed, additional questions emerged:

* Are there clusters of high-casualty events in specific regions?
* Can any seasonal patterns or significant changes across years be identified?

### Data
**Sources**:

* **Incident Data**: Mass shooting data was sourced from [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) and covers mass shootings from 2018 to 2024. 
* **City-Level Geographic Data**: The SimpleMaps US cities dataset provided latitude (`lat`) and longitude (`lng`) for cities represented in the mass shooting data.
* **State-Level Demographics**: State-level demographic and socioeconomic data were obtained from the U.S. Census website for analysis. 

**Processing Steps**: 

* Annual datasets obtained through webscraping (`mass_shootings_2018` to `mass_shootings_2024`) were merged to create a consolidated dataset, `mass_shootings_2018_2024_cleaned.csv`.The variables included in this dataset are `date`, `city`, `state`, `dead`, `injured`, `total`, `description` for each shooting event recorded (HOW MANY OBSERVATIONS?) 

* Using data from the SimpleMaps US cities dataset, latitude (`lat`) and longitude (`lng`) variables were appended to each city represented in the dataset to create a new dataset `gun_df.csv`. This was to allow for spatial/geographical visualizations/analyses. 

* CLEANINGSJDNGDSN Rows containing any `NA` values were removed. 

* For state-level analysis, data for each state was extracted from the U.S. Census website. This process created the final dataset, `state_data.csv`, which provides information on state-level demographics and statistics. Inlcuded are 5-year aggregated estimates ending in 2022 (i.e., the latest 5-year American Community Survey estimates). (WHAT DOES EACH ROW SHOW)

## EDA and Dicussions 

Our project focused on understanding trends in gun-related incidents by analyzing data across time and location. We began by identifying patterns year by year and then narrowed our focus to quarterly trends. Next, we examined geographic patterns, first by state and then by city, using GIS tools to map incident hotspots. Inspired by John Snow’s historical work on cholera mapping, we used this approach to uncover potential causes and effects of gun-related incidents across the United States. Finally, we analyzed details of individual incidents, including the number of victims, to differentiate between types of violence, such as suicides, intimate partner violence, and multi-victim crimes.

Gun-related crimes were often concentrated in economically disadvantaged urban and rural areas, particularly in regions that have experienced industrial decline. Urban areas showed higher rates of multi-victim crimes, including gang violence and robberies, whereas rural areas had more single-victim incidents, often linked to suicides or domestic violence. These differences highlight how socioeconomic conditions shape the nature of gun violence.

We also found that gun-related incidents tended to peak at the end of the year, possibly due to increased stress during the holiday season. Over time, however, crime rates have gradually declined, with a sharper drop in multi-victim incidents compared to single-victim cases. This suggests that while efforts to reduce violent crimes like homicides may be effective, suicides—particularly those linked to mental health struggles—remain a persistent challenge.

Overall, the findings emphasize the need for targeted mental health resources and community-based interventions tailored to both urban and rural settings. By combining trend analysis with GIS mapping and socioeconomic insights, our project highlights the complex factors driving gun violence and offers a foundation for informed policy and public health strategies.

Some notable items from EDA include: 

### Geographic Analysis Using “Hot Zones”
Beyond a traditional heat map representation, the analysis utilized an advanced “hot zone” mapping technique, which provided a nuanced understanding of crime distributions at a city-wide level. Unlike simple density-based visualizations,these hot zones highlighted regions with concentrated crime activity, offering a more granular perspective on geographic crime patterns. This approach illuminated the spatial heterogeneity of criminal activity, revealing stark contrasts between neighborhoods and cities. The visualizations were particularly insightful in demonstrating how crime clusters correspond to underlying socioeconomic realities, enabling an explanation of how such disparities are spatially distributed.

### Exploratory Data Analysis and Public Health Correlations
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) underscored and solidified known public health trends through detailed tabular and graphical summaries. These tools provided a robust foundation for validating hypotheses regarding the intersection of socioeconomic conditions and crime rates. Key findings reaffirmed the strong correlation between poverty rates and crime prevalence. States and localities with high poverty levels exhibited the greatest frequency of crimes and the highest number of victims per incident. In contrast, areas with low poverty rates experienced significantly lower crime rates and fewer victims per crime. Among the states analyzed, Louisiana and Mississippi emerged as consistent outliers with high crime rates, reflecting systemic socioeconomic challenges. Conversely, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut demonstrated exemplary performance with some of the lowest crime statistics in the dataset.

### Socioeconomic Contrasts: The Case of Washington, D.C.
Washington, D.C., stood out as a particularly notable case, embodying stark socioeconomic contrasts. Despite its status as one of the wealthiest regions in the United States, with an estimated GDP per capita reaching as high as $295,000 annually in certain districts, this wealth is highly localized to the Capitol and adjacent affluent neighborhoods. The surrounding areas, including suburbs and communities such as Tanor Park and Silver Spring, are among the nation’s most impoverished and crime-affected zones. This extreme socioeconomic inequality within a compact geographic region is a primary driver of D.C.’s dichotomous profile, characterized by both extraordinary wealth and pervasive criminality.

### Anomalous Patterns in Maine
One of the more unexpected findings pertained to Maine. When examining the number of
victims per incident without adjusting for state population (unscaled analysis), Maine presented a higher-than-expected rate compared to national averages. This anomaly can be attributed to the state’s unique mix of urbanized areas, such as Bangor, Augusta, and Bar Harbor, juxtaposed with its predominantly rural landscape. The data suggests that criminal activity in Maine follows a consistent pattern across both urban and rural areas, but this uniformity leads to elevated per- incident victim counts when state population is not accounted for. While this trend does not entirely deviate from national norms, it is notable in the context of Maine’s demographic and geographic composition.

## EDA Limitation

It is important to note that the data makes to distinction between homicide and suicide, and since suicide is technically a crime, it is reported in the gun-related crime statistics without any differentiation. As public health professionals, it is important to realize that while suicide is a trajdey it the life course, personality matrix, and present economic condition that pushes an individual to suicide is often appreciable different that those who commit homicide.

Finally, one last limitation is that there is no reality recent data. Being able to assess the affects of the economic downturn due to the dual problems of inflation and loss of economic activity meaning that people were making less money and the money they were making was worth less, greatly accelerating the economic pressures into criminality. 

## Summary

Through an analysis of general trends and basic GIS mapping of the available data, our findings aligned with established patterns in public health. We observed that both the number of crimes and the number of individuals affected by these crimes have decreased over time, reflecting broader societal improvements in reducing violence and its impacts. This decline underscores the value of continued public health efforts to address the root causes of violence and promote safer communities.
