### Motivation
Gun violence remains a significant public health issue in the United States. Our project explores gun-related incidents (mass shootings) in the U.S. from 2018 to 2024. These events, unfortunately, have become increasingly common, with significant implications for public safety, policy, and mental health. This project aims to identify trends, patterns, and geographic hotspots associated with these tragic events. These insights can inform policymakers, law enforcement, and public health initiatives targeting gun violence reduction. The analysis includes temporal trends, geographic distribution, and incident severity. 

### Related Work
Existing research on mass shootings has often focused on patterns of violence, gun control, and the social factors that influence the occurrence of these tragic events. Our project seeks to build on this body of research by employing statistical methods to reveal more refined insights into the data. The project draws inspiration from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) website (which aggregates mass shooting data), and from recent academic literature focusing on geographic and temporal trends in gun violence. Classroom analyses of spatial data also guided this work.

### Initial Questions 
We started with basic questions such as:

* What are the spatial and temporal trends in mass shootings from 2018-2024?
* Are there patterns in the number of casualties (`dead`, `injured`, `total`) based on location or time of year?
* How does the distribution of mass shootings vary across cities and states?

As the analysis progressed, additional questions emerged:

* Are there clusters of high-casualty events in specific regions?
* Can any seasonal patterns or significant changes across years be identified?

### Data
**Sources**:

* **Incident Data**: Mass shooting data was sourced from [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) and covers mass shootings from 2018 to 2024. 
* **City-Level Geographic Data**: The SimpleMaps US cities dataset provided latitude (`lat`) and longitude (`lng`) for cities represented in the mass shooting data.
* **State-Level Demographics**: State-level demographic and socioeconomic data were obtained from the U.S. Census website for analysis. 

**Processing Steps**: 

* Annual datasets obtained through webscraping (`mass_shootings_2018` to `mass_shootings_2024`) were merged to create a consolidated dataset, `mass_shootings_2018_2024_cleaned.csv`.The variables included in this dataset are `date`, `city`, `state`, `dead`, `injured`, `total`, `description` for each shooting event recorded (HOW MANY OBSERVATIONS?) 

* Using data from the SimpleMaps US cities dataset, latitude (`lat`) and longitude (`lng`) variables were appended to each city represented in the dataset to create a new dataset `gun_df.csv`. This was to allow for spatial/geographical visualizations/analyses. 

* CLEANINGSJDNGDSN Rows containing any `NA` values were removed. 

* For state-level analysis, data for each state was extracted from the U.S. Census website. This process created the final dataset, `state_data.csv`, which provides information on state-level demographics and statistics. Inlcuded are 5-year aggregated estimates ending in 2022 (i.e., the latest 5-year American Community Survey estimates). (WHAT DOES EACH ROW SHOW)


# Geographic Analysis Using “Hot Zones”
Beyond a traditional heat map representation, the analysis utilized an advanced “hot zone” mapping technique, which provided a nuanced understanding of crime distributions at a city-wide level. Unlike simple density-based visualizations,these hot zones highlighted regions with concentrated crime activity, offering a more granular perspective on geographic crime patterns. This approach illuminated the spatial heterogeneity of criminal activity, revealing stark contrasts between neighborhoods and cities. The visualizations were particularly insightful in demonstrating how crime clusters correspond to underlying socioeconomic realities, enabling an explanation of how such disparities are spatially distributed.

# Exploratory Data Analysis and Public Health Correlations
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) underscored and solidified known public health trends through detailed tabular and graphical summaries. These tools provided a robust foundation for validating hypotheses regarding the intersection of socioeconomic conditions and crime rates. Key findings reaffirmed the strong correlation between poverty rates and crime prevalence. States and localities with high poverty levels exhibited the greatest frequency of crimes and the highest number of victims per incident. In contrast, areas with low poverty rates experienced significantly lower crime rates and fewer victims per crime. Among the states analyzed, Louisiana and Mississippi emerged as consistent outliers with high crime rates, reflecting systemic socioeconomic challenges. Conversely, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut demonstrated exemplary performance with some of the lowest crime statistics in the dataset.

# Socioeconomic Contrasts: The Case of Washington, D.C.
Washington, D.C., stood out as a particularly notable case, embodying stark socioeconomic contrasts. Despite its status as one of the wealthiest regions in the United States, with an estimated GDP per capita reaching as high as $295,000 annually in certain districts, this wealth is highly localized to the Capitol and adjacent affluent neighborhoods. The surrounding areas, including suburbs and communities such as Tanor Park and Silver Spring, are among the nation’s most impoverished and crime-affected zones. This extreme socioeconomic inequality within a compact geographic region is a primary driver of D.C.’s dichotomous profile, characterized by both extraordinary wealth and pervasive criminality.

# Anomalous Patterns in Maine
One of the more unexpected findings pertained to Maine. When examining the number of
victims per incident without adjusting for state population (unscaled analysis), Maine presented a higher-than-expected rate compared to national averages. This anomaly can be attributed to the state’s unique mix of urbanized areas, such as Bangor, Augusta, and Bar Harbor, juxtaposed with its predominantly rural landscape. The data suggests that criminal activity in Maine follows a consistent pattern across both urban and rural areas, but this uniformity leads to elevated per- incident victim counts when state population is not accounted for. While this trend does not entirely deviate from national norms, it is notable in the context of Maine’s demographic and geographic composition.
