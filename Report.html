<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Analyzing Mass Shootings in the U.S.
(2018-2024)</h1>

</div>


<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>
<p>Gun violence remains a significant public health issue in the United
States. Our project explores gun-related incidents (mass shootings) in
the U.S. from 2018 to 2024. These events, unfortunately, have become
increasingly common, with significant implications for public safety,
policy, and mental health. This project aims to identify trends,
patterns, and geographic hotspots associated with these tragic events.
These insights can inform policymakers, law enforcement, and public
health initiatives targeting gun violence reduction. The analysis
includes temporal trends, geographic distribution, and incident
severity.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Related Work</strong></h2>
<p>Existing research on mass shootings has often focused on patterns of
violence, gun control, and the social factors that influence the
occurrence of these tragic events. Our project seeks to build on this
body of research by employing statistical methods to reveal more refined
insights into the data. The project draws inspiration from the Gun
Violence Archive (GVA) website (which aggregates mass shooting data),
and from recent academic literature focusing on geographic and temporal
trends in gun violence. Classroom analyses of spatial data also guided
this work.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Initial Questions</strong></h2>
<p>We started with basic questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the spatial and temporal trends in mass shootings from
2018-2024?</li>
<li>Are there patterns in the number of casualties (<code>dead</code>,
<code>injured</code>, <code>total</code>) based on location or time of
year?</li>
<li>How does the distribution of mass shootings vary across cities and
states?</li>
</ul>
<p>As the analysis progressed, additional questions emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there clusters of high-casualty events in specific regions?</li>
<li>Can any seasonal patterns or significant changes across years be
identified?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Data</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Sources</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incident Data</strong>: Mass shooting data was sourced from
<a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/">Gun Violence Archive</a>
and covers mass shootings from 2018 to 2024.</li>
<li><strong>City-Level Geographic Data</strong>: The SimpleMaps US
cities dataset provided latitude (<code>lat</code>) and longitude
(<code>lng</code>) for cities represented in the mass shooting
data.</li>
<li><strong>State-Level Demographics</strong>: State-level demographic
and socioeconomic data were obtained from the U.S. Census website for
analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Processing Steps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Annual datasets obtained through webscraping
(<code>mass_shootings_2018</code> to <code>mass_shootings_2024</code>)
were merged to create a consolidated dataset,
<code>mass_shootings_2018_2024_cleaned.csv</code>. The variables
included in this dataset are <code>date</code>, <code>city</code>,
<code>state</code>, <code>dead</code>, <code>injured</code>,
<code>total</code>, <code>description</code> for each shooting event
recorded from 2018 to 2024.</p></li>
<li><p>Using data from the SimpleMaps US cities dataset, latitude
(<code>lat</code>) and longitude (<code>lng</code>) variables were
appended to each city represented in the dataset to create a new dataset
<code>gun_df.csv</code>. This was to allow for spatial/geographical
visualizations/analyses.</p></li>
<li><p>For state-level analysis, data for each state was extracted from
the U.S. Census website. This process created the final dataset,
<code>state_data.csv</code>. Each row in the state_data.csv dataset
represents a specific state and its demographic, economic, and social
statistics for a 5-year period ending in 2022. It provides information
about the state’s total population, median income, unemployment rate,
percentage of residents with a bachelor’s degree or higher, poverty
rate, uninsured rate, and vacancy rate.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Exploratory Analysis</strong></h2>
<div id="eda-summary" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>EDA Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Through an analysis of general trends and basic GIS mapping of the
available data, our findings aligned with established patterns in public
health. We observed that both the number of crimes and the number of
individuals affected by these crimes have decreased over time,
reflecting broader societal improvements in reducing violence and its
impacts. This decline underscores the value of continued public health
efforts to address the root causes of violence and promote safer
communities.</p>
<p>The dataset contains information on gun-related incidents from 2018
to 2024 across different cities and states in the United States.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>date</code>: Date of the incident (class:
<code>Date</code>)</li>
<li><code>city</code>: City where the incident occurred (class:
<code>character</code>)</li>
<li><code>state</code>: State where the incident occurred (class:
<code>character</code>)</li>
<li><code>dead</code>: Number of fatalities (class:
<code>integer</code>)</li>
<li><code>injured</code>: Number of injuries (class:
<code>integer</code>)</li>
<li><code>total</code>: Total number of victims (Dead + Injured) (class:

<div
id="comparing-number-of-incidents-by-year-quarter-month-and-weekday"
class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Comparing Number of Incidents by Year, Quarter, Month, and
Weekday</strong></h3>
<div id="by-year" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>By Year:</strong></h4>
<p>First, we will compare the number of incidents by year.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>The graph shows a general upward trend in gun-related incidents from
2018 to 2022. The peak would be at 717 incidents. The year 2020 shows a
significant increase, rising from 441 incidents in 2019 to 617
incidents, and the trend continues with 703 incidents in 2021. However,
from 2023 to 2024, the number of incidents appear to decline, with 596
incidents in 2023 and 538 incidents in 2024. This suggests that while
the number of incidents has increased over the past few years, the
decline in recent years might reflect a shift in trends or external
factors impacting the data. Further analysis would be needed to
understand the variations in detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-quarter" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>By Quarter:</strong></h4>
<p>We will now compare the number of incidents by quarter for each
year.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>Let’s further break it down by years and quarters.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>The dataset on incidents of gun violence from 2018-2024 show some
seasonality. We notice incidents in Q1 and Q4 are generally lower than
those in Q2 and Q3. The second graph highlights that Q1 incidents
increased steadily from 2018 to 2021, with smaller increases observed
between 2021 and 2022, as well as between 2022 and 2023, suggesting a
leveling-off trend during this period. In 2024, there is a slight
decrease compared to 2023, but it is important to consider that 2024 is
not yet complete. This potential plateau in Q1 incidents could signal a
stabilization, though the overall trend since 2018 indicates a
significant increase that still warrants attention.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-month" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>By Month:</strong></h4>
<p>We will now compare the number of incidents by months.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>The graph shows the number of incidents by month. Again, we see a
clear seasonal trend. Incidents steadily rise from January through July,
peaking in July (likely due to heightened activity during the summer
months). A sharp decline follows from August to December, with November
and December showing the lowest numbers. This could be influenced by
colder weather, holiday periods, or shorter months (i.e., February). The
visible trends suggest a relationship between weather (seasonal
variations), social behavior, and incident rates. You can hover over the
bars for exact values to compare these trends in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-date" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>By Date:</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s see the dates with the most incidents.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>The table highlights the dates with the highest total number of
incidents, aggregated over 2018-2024. July 5th and July 4th stand out
with 49 and 48 incidents respectively, indicating that Independence Day
celebrations significantly contribute to increased incidents, likely due
to festivities and the use of fireworks or firearms. January 1st, with
31 incidents, suggests that New Year’s Day also brings heightened risk,
potentially linked to post-midnight celebrations and gatherings. The
remaining dates predominantly occur in late June and July, with totals
ranging from 21 to 26 incidents, reflecting a seasonal peak in incidents
during summer months. May 18th, while slightly earlier, still aligns
closely with this summer trend, reinforcing the pattern of increased
incidents during warmer months. These results show the influence of
holidays and seasonal trends on incident rates.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-weekday" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>By Weekday:</strong></h4>
<p>We will now compare the number of incidents by weekday.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>Sunday stands out as the most dangerous day, with incidents far
exceeding 900. Saturdays follow closely with around 900 incidents.
Fridays show a moderate increase with about 450 incidents, marking the
start of the weekend.Meanwhile, weekdays see significantly lower
numbers, with Tuesday recording the fewest incidents at around 200,
followed by Thursday at about 350, Wednesday at 375, and Monday at 440.
This trend show the influence of weekends or leisure culture on the
frequency of incidents, with weekdays being relatively safer perhaps due
to structured routines and fewer late-night activities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="incidents-by-state" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Incidents by State</strong></h3>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>The interactive bar graph above shows absolute number of gun violence
by states. Hovering over the bars shows a label with the absolute number
of incidents for a state. Illinois has the highest number of gun
violence cases followed by Texas and California.</p>
</div>
<div id="incidents-relative-to-state-population" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Incidents Relative to State Population</strong></h3>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>This table provides the numerical values for the number of incidents,
2017 population, and the scaled number of incidents per 100,000
people.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>This is the Number of Incidents scaled to state population. The order
changes quite drastically where the District of Columbia, Louisiana, and
Mississippi now lead and Idaho, Wyoming, and New Hampshire now have the
lowest though the bottom is much more concentrated.</p>

<h4><strong>Interactive Map of Incidents by State:</strong></h4>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>Here an interactive map which displays the same data. It is scaled

but it conveys the same data in a more engaging format.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="victims-by-state" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Victims by State</strong></h3>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>This table provides the number of victims by state and the number of
victims per incident by state. This shows how many people were involved
in the average incident by state.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>The bar graph above shows the number of victims per incident by
state. Maine has the highest victims by incidents followed by
Washington, DC followed by Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>This shows the average number of victims per incident when we scale
by state. There is another dramatic reordering with Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Illinois now taking the top spot. There is no data for
DC.</p>
<div id="interactive-map-of-victims-by-state" class="section level4">

State.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>Here are the number of incidents per New York City.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>For a city of 8 million people this seems quite low. This suggests
that crime has fallen dramatically, crime is under-reported, or that the
data collection mechanism is selective.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>The bar graph above shows the number of incidents by city. Chicago
has the highest number of incidents followed by Philadelphia followed by
New York City.</p>
<div id="merging-location-data-for-incident-mapping"

<div id="geographic-analysis-using-hot-zones" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Geographic Analysis Using “Hot Zones”</strong>:</h4>
<p>Beyond a traditional heat map representation, the analysis utilized
an advanced “hot zone” mapping technique, which provided a nuanced
understanding of crime distributions at a city-wide level. Unlike simple
density-based visualizations,these hot zones highlighted regions with
concentrated crime activity, offering a more granular perspective on
geographic crime patterns. This approach illuminated the spatial
heterogeneity of criminal activity, revealing stark contrasts between
neighborhoods and cities. The visualizations were particularly
insightful in demonstrating how crime clusters correspond to underlying
socioeconomic realities, enabling an explanation of how such disparities
are spatially distributed.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis-and-public-health-correlations"
class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis and Public Health
Correlations</strong>:</h4>
<p>The exploratory data analysis (EDA) underscored and solidified known
public health trends through detailed tabular and graphical summaries.
These tools provided a robust foundation for validating hypotheses
regarding the intersection of socioeconomic conditions and crime rates.
Key findings reaffirmed the strong correlation between poverty rates and
crime prevalence. States and localities with high poverty levels
exhibited the greatest frequency of crimes and the highest number of
victims per incident. In contrast, areas with low poverty rates
experienced significantly lower crime rates and fewer victims per crime.
Among the states analyzed, Louisiana and Mississippi emerged as
consistent outliers with high crime rates, reflecting systemic
socioeconomic challenges. Conversely, New Hampshire, Vermont, and
Connecticut demonstrated exemplary performance with some of the lowest
crime statistics in the dataset.</p>

<h4><strong>Socioeconomic Contrasts: The Case of Washington,
D.C.</strong>:</h4>
<p>Washington, D.C., stood out as a particularly notable case, embodying
stark socioeconomic contrasts. Despite its status as one of the
wealthiest regions in the United States, with an estimated GDP per
capita reaching as high as $295,000 annually in certain districts, this
wealth is highly localized to the Capitol and adjacent affluent
neighborhoods. The surrounding areas, including suburbs and communities
such as Tanor Park and Silver Spring, are among the nation’s most
impoverished and crime-affected zones. This extreme socioeconomic
inequality within a compact geographic region is a primary driver of
D.C.’s dichotomous profile, characterized by both extraordinary wealth
and pervasive criminality.</p>

<h4><strong>Anomalous Patterns in Maine</strong>:</h4>
<p>One of the more unexpected findings pertained to Maine. When
examining the number of victims per incident without adjusting for state
population (unscaled analysis), Maine presented a higher-than-expected
rate compared to national averages. This anomaly can be attributed to
the state’s unique mix of urbanized areas, such as Bangor, Augusta, and
Bar Harbor, juxtaposed with its predominantly rural landscape. The data
suggests that criminal activity in Maine follows a consistent pattern
across both urban and rural areas, but this uniformity leads to elevated
per- incident victim counts when state population is not accounted for.
While this trend does not entirely deviate from national norms, it is
notable in the context of Maine’s demographic and geographic
composition.</p>

<h2><strong>Discussion</strong></h2>
<p>Our project focused on understanding trends in gun-related incidents
by analyzing data across time and location. We began by identifying
patterns year by year and then narrowed our focus to quarterly trends.
Next, we examined geographic patterns, first by state and then by city,
using GIS tools to map incident hotspots. Inspired by John Snow’s
historical work on cholera mapping, we used this approach to uncover
potential causes and effects of gun-related incidents across the United
States. Finally, we analyzed details of individual incidents, including
the number of victims, to differentiate between types of violence, such
as suicides, intimate partner violence, and multi-victim crimes.</p>
<p>Gun-related crimes were often concentrated in economically
disadvantaged urban and rural areas, particularly in regions that have
experienced industrial decline. Urban areas showed higher rates of
multi-victim crimes, including gang violence and robberies, whereas
rural areas had more single-victim incidents, often linked to suicides
or domestic violence. These differences highlight how socioeconomic
conditions shape the nature of gun violence.</p>
<p>We also found that gun-related incidents tended to peak at the end of
the year, possibly due to increased stress during the holiday season.
Over time, however, crime rates have gradually declined, with a sharper
drop in multi-victim incidents compared to single-victim cases. This
suggests that while efforts to reduce violent crimes like homicides may
be effective, suicides—particularly those linked to mental health
struggles—remain a persistent challenge.</p>
<p>Overall, the findings emphasize the need for targeted mental health
resources and community-based interventions tailored to both urban and
rural settings. By combining trend analysis with GIS mapping and
socioeconomic insights, our project highlights the complex factors
driving gun violence and offers a foundation for informed policy and
public health strategies.</p>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>
<p>Our analysis was constrained by several limitations in the data.
First, the data did not distinguish between homicides and suicides,
categorizing both as gun-related crimes. This lack of differentiation is
significant, as the underlying factors driving suicide often differ
markedly from those leading to homicide. While both are tragedies,
suicides are typically influenced by a combination of life course
events, individual personality traits, and economic conditions, whereas
homicides often involve interpersonal conflict or criminal activity.</p>
<p>Another major limitation was the lack of recent data. This gap made
it impossible to analyze the effects of recent economic downturns caused
by inflation and reduced economic activity. These dual challenges—wages
losing value due to inflation and fewer income-generating
opportunities—likely exacerbated economic pressures, potentially driving
increases in criminal behavior. Addressing these limitations in future
research would provide a clearer understanding of how contemporary
economic and social factors influence gun-related violence.</p>
<p>This project has limitations that should be considered when
interpreting the findings. First, the dataset may suffer from reporting
bias and incomplete records, as mass shooting incidents are not
uniformly defined or reported across states, possibly skewing the
analysis. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations are
constrained by the granularity of state-level data, which masks
intra-state variations (e.g., differences between urban and rural
areas). In the modeling phase, multicollinearity among socio-economic
predictors may have influenced the reliability of individual variable
coefficients despite mitigation efforts. The choice of linear regression
is effective for understanding relationships. However, it assumes
linearity and does not capture potential non-linear patterns or
interactions between variables. Visualizations are informative but may
oversimplify socio-economic relationships by presenting trends without
accounting for the underlying variance or contextual factors. Finally,
while bootstrapping and cross-validation provided robustness to model
evaluation, the relatively small number of observations (limited by the
number of states) weakens the statistical power and generalizability of
the findings. Future work should explore more granular, longitudinal
data and possible non-linear modeling techniques to better capture the
fluctuations in mass shootings and their predictors.</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The exploratory data analysis of the dataset (which covers related
incidents in the U.S. from 2018 to 2024) reveals a few noteworthy trends
and patterns. Incidents have generally increased over the years, peaking
in 2022, with seasonal variations showing higher occurrences during
summer months and weekends, particularly Sundays. Specific holidays like
Independence Day and New Year’s Day also contribute to spikes in
incidents. State-level analysis highlights Illinois, Texas, and
California as having the highest absolute numbers, while
population-adjusted rates show the District of Columbia, Louisiana, and
Mississippi leading. Overall, we were able to observe the temporal,
geographic, and demographic factors on gun violence, highlighting the
importance of context in understanding trends for safety or preventative
measures.</p>
<p>The modeling section employed regression techniques to analyze total
shootings across U.S. states, focusing on socioeconomic predictors.
Initial data preprocessing included merging and scaling dataset for
interpretability, following by correlation analysis revealing strong
positive associations, especially between shootings and population size.
Poisson regression identified predictors like
<code>total_populationE</code> and <code>median_incomeE</code> but
showed overdispersion, requiring a Negative Binomial model. This refined
model addressed multicollinearity by excluding highly correlated
variables like <code>poverty_rate</code> and
<code>bachelors_and_higher</code> to improve interpretability and
predictive accuracy. Validation through bootstrap sampling and Monte
Carlo cross-validation confirmed the robustness of the model with
consistent coefficients and reliable predictions. Model performance was
further assessed via RMSE comparisons and visualized predictions which
reinforced its application in understanding the relationship of
state-level factors influencing shooting incidents.</p>
