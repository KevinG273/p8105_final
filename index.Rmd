Gun violence is a public health and safety issue in the United States, which consistently experiences higher levels of firearm-related incidents compared to other developed countries. This project seeks to provide an analysis of gun violence across dimensions (i.e., temporal, geographic, and demographic factors). With the constitutional right to bear arms embedded in American society, understanding patterns and trends in gun violence could help guide policymakers, law enforcement, and public health officials in informing strategies involving gun violence.

### Project Objectives

- **Analyze Temporal Trends**: Investigate changes in gun violence incidents over time (yearly and seasonal trends).
- **Examine Geographic Disparities**: Identify high-risk states and cities, adjusting for population size to assess disparities.
- **Assess Demographic Characteristics**: Conduct statistical tests and modeling to explore the relationship between mass shootings and demographic factors in each state.
- **Present Findings**: Use interactive visualizations and maps to communicate findings and raise awareness.
